# Conflicts Between EPICs (and Resolution)

## Epic 1 vs Epic 2

- Conflict: Epic 2 needs user profiles (budget, preferences) from Epic 1.
- Resolution: Complete Epic 1 early in Sprint 1.


## 2. Epic 2 vs Epic 3

- Conflict: Epic 2 requires MongoDB schemas from Epic 3.
- Resolution: Finalize schemas in first half of Sprint 1.


## 3. Epic 4 vs Epic 5

- Conflict: Exporting itineraries (Epic 5) depends on enriched data (Epic 4).
- Resolution: Delay Epic 5 until after Epic 4 completes.


## 4. Epic 6 vs All

- Conflict: Optimization requires stable features.
- Resolution: Schedule Epic 6 tasks at end of each sprint.


## 5. Sprint-Level Resource Conflict
   
- Conflict: Sprint 1 has Epics 1, 2, 3 simultaneously → heavy backend load.
- Resolution: Backend team handles Epics 1 & 3 first, frontend handles Epic 2 UI.
