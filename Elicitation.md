# Elicitation Techniques

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication & Profile Management
- **Interviews:** To learn about their preferred login techniques, security concerns, and the significance of personal profiles, we conducted interviews with students and frequent travelers. This enabled us to create a safe and user-friendly login process.  
- **Surveys:** Collected feedback from a larger audience on login preferences and profile features, confirming that users want safe and reliable ways to store their travel data.  
- **Prototyping:** Created mock-ups of the signup and login screens to test usability and flow, adjusting designs based on user feedback.  

### AI-Powered Itinerary Generation
- **Brainstorming:** Held team sessions to explore how itineraries could be generated automatically, including prioritizing destinations and suggesting activities efficiently.  
- **Surveys:** Collected input on the level of personalization users expect, and which aspects of their trip—like duration, interests, or budget—matter most.  

### Real-Time Updates (Weather, Closures)
- **Interviews:** Asked users which types of travel updates matter the most, such as sudden closures or weather changes.  
- **Surveys:** Validated which real-time notifications were considered essential, helping us prioritize this feature in development.  

### Budget Estimation & Tracking
- **Interviews:** Asked users how they currently manage and track expenses, especially in group trips.  
- **Surveys:** Measured demand for automated cost estimation and expense tracking to ensure the feature meets real user needs.  

### Itinerary Customization (Edit/Reorder)
- **Brainstorming:** Discussed ways to make itineraries flexible, allowing users to edit, reorder, or remove activities.  
- **Survey Forms:** Collected feedback from users on how important customization is for them, and what kind of controls (edit, drag-and-drop, delete) they expect when adjusting itineraries.  

### Group Planning Tools (Split Budget, Vote)
- **Interviews:** Collected insights on how groups make decisions and manage shared expenses.  
- **Surveys:** Gathered feedback from users about how much they value collaborative tools like voting on activities and splitting budgets, which helped us decide how important it was to include these features.  

### Export & Share Itinerary (PDF, Calendar)
- **Prototyping:** Will test export and sharing interfaces to ensure they are intuitive and easy to use.  
- **Surveys:** Confirmed that users want to share itineraries with friends, family, or colleagues.  

### Key Integrations (Hotels, Transport)
- **Studying Documentation:** Reviewed APIs for hotels and transport services to confirm integration feasibility.  
- **Surveys:** Verified that users are interested in booking accommodations and transport through the platform, reinforcing its priority.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- **Interviews:** Learned that users expect a simple, intuitive interface with clear navigation.  
- **Surveys:** Measured how easily users can interact with the platform and their tolerance for complexity.  
- **Prototyping:** Created UI mock-ups to gather feedback and refine the design for clarity and efficiency.  

### Performance
- **Interviews:** Asked users what “fast response” means for tasks like loading itineraries or receiving updates.  
- **Surveys:** Collected feedback on acceptable response times to guide performance targets.  

### System Availability
- **Interviews:** Consulted technical stakeholders to determine acceptable downtime and recovery times.  
- **Risk Analysis:** Identified potential failure points and planned strategies to maintain high availability.  

### Data Security
- **Interviews:** Explored user concerns about storing personal information and travel history.  
- **Misuse Cases:** Considered risks like unauthorized access, data leaks, and phishing attacks to define strong security requirements.
