### VOYAGR User Groups

#### Main Users

* **Students and Young Adults (Aged 18-25):** Young people who are good with technology and plan fun trips for themselves or with friends while trying to save money. We learned about this group from our **surveys**, which showed that 100% of people who answered were in this age group, majority were students, and 66.7% wanted help with tracking their spending.

* **Family Planners:** People who plan trips for their whole family and need help organizing everyone. Our **surveys** showed us that this is a very important group, as traveling with family is the most common type of trip (88.9%).

#### Other Users

* **Solo and Niche Travelers:** This group includes people who travel by themselves or have special rules they must follow, like needing certain kinds of food. We learned about this group from the written answers in our **survey**, where some people mentioned needing things like "Jain Food".

* **Business Travelers:** This includes people who travel for work and would use the app to organize their business trips, not for vacations. Our team thought of this group during our **Team Brainstorming** meetings as a possible new audience for the app in the future.
